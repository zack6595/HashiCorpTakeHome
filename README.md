This is a technical writing and editing project as part of your interview.

This project is designed to take between 1.5 - 2 hours.

## Instructions

Before you start editing, you should set up a working environment and learn about our editing process.

Create a git repository on GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or any other git hosting service. 

Read the style guide snippets, which is a subset of our official engineering style guide, and the guide template. Then make improvements to the sample prose so it embodies the principles in the style guide. 

### Get started

Download the `terraform-getting-started.md` file. You can download the entire gist as as zip or by clicking the "Raw" button so that you can copy and paste the content. Before editing, commit the inital `terraform-getting-started.md` file to the repo that you have created for this project. 

For this project, you will submit your changes as a pull request. If you are not familiar with the pull request process, review the documenation for [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request), [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/creating_merge_requests.html), or [Bitbucket](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/create-a-pull-request-to-merge-your-change/). Create a new branch where you will make your changes to the sample. 

### Edit the sample

Now that your environment is set up, you can start to edit the sample on your local machine. Complete the following tasks, make all changes in Markdown.

- Look for and fix any spelling or grammar issues.
- Edit the text for readability and compatibility with the style guide.
- Add the outputs in Markdown for all the commands. 
- Add section titles that are compatible with the guide template.
- Add learning objectives to the introduction.
- Add additional sections and content for both prerequisites and next steps. 

### Submit your sample

- Commit your changes to the `terraform-getting-started.md` file and push to the repository.
- Open a pull request. 
- Send the pull request link to your recruiting contact for review. It will be easiest if this is a public repository.
